# STNNCB

**Repository Description:**

This repository contains a Flask-based web application and a website that demonstrate the implementation of a chatbot powered by TensorFlow. Please note that this chatbot is still in the early stages of development and should be considered a rough starting point for further exploration. It may require additional diverse data and improvements to achieve optimal performance.

**Key Features:**

Flask-based Web Application: The repository includes a Flask server script (server.py) that serves as the backend for the web application. It handles user requests, interacts with the chatbot, and generates appropriate responses.

Interactive Website: The repository also includes a website (index.html, game.js, explanations.json, style.css, script.js) that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot. Users can input their queries, receive responses, and engage in interactive conversations.

Machine Learning Chatbot: The chatbot utilizes TensorFlow to generate responses based on user input. It demonstrates the application of natural language processing techniques and pre-trained models to provide contextually relevant answers.

**Use Cases:**

Learning and Research: This repository serves as an educational resource and starting point for developers, researchers, or students interested in chatbot development and natural language processing. It provides an opportunity to explore and experiment with the chatbot's functionality, modify the underlying models, and contribute to its improvement.

**Requirements:**

To run the application, the following dependencies are required:

Flask

TensorFlow

NumPy

Pandas

Sklearn

CORS
